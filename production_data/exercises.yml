  name: Backward Moving Crossovers
  description: The two primary points of emphasis for this exercise would be 1) the
    quick repositioning or opening up of the inside foot with a down and back drive,
    and 2) the lean in the direction you want to go, or control of your momentum.
    This pattern will help you with your defensive footwork and off ball acceleration.

  name: 1 Touch Right & Left
  description: This exercise will be used as a warm up in later phases. The primary
    focus is to reposition the body (quick backpedal) in such a way that you can move
    forward into every pass. This repositioning strategy will be a key element later
    on, as we look to create passing angles and play quick 1 touch combinations. Start
    off in a smooth and rhythmic tempo, then increase the pace (weight) of the pass
    to create a more challenging touch.

  name: Outside Touch to Ripacross Reset
  description: As you perform this exercise, take an outside touch wide (away from
    the body), then aggressively rip the ball back across your body and kill it inside
    your frame with an inside stop. The reset is all one motion. The foot rips the
    ball back and settles it with the inside touch without hitting the ground, designed
    to reposition the ball into a offensive threat position.

  description: In the 6 cone set up, place the cones about 1 yard (or less) apart.
    Guide the ball through the pattern, going down 2 gates, then back 1. Shift your
    focus to being quick down 2 then smooth back 1, or smooth down 2 then quick back
    1 for an added challenge. A 4 Star rating would mean that you had total command
    of the touches and felt both rhythmic and quick through the pattern.

  description: "Start with the MB (or light dumbbell) held firmly against your chest.
    Use the first set to focus on the deceleration phase of the motion, dropping into
    an athletic position that you feel you can burst out of with power. Each set,
    focus on increasing the speed in which you transition, get more explosive (height),
    and get quicker off the ground (not as much depth). \r\n\r\nGive yourself 4 Stars
    if you feel you can control this pattern as you decelerate, as you get maximum
    height in every vertical burst."
